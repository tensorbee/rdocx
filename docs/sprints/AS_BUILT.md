# As Built

Append-only completion log. One entry per F-ID, written by `/complete-feature`
at the moment of completion, describing what was actually built rather than what
was planned.

Entries are never edited after the fact. When a later story changes something
recorded here, the later story gets its own entry. The design intent lives in
`docs/hld/`, the plan lives in `.claude/plans/F-XXX-design.md`, and this file is
the record of what happened.

Newest entries at the bottom.

## Entry template

```markdown
### F-XXX, Short title

**Sprint.** SNN
**Completed.** YYYY-MM-DD
**Size.** S | M | L, estimated N days, actual N days

**What was built.** One paragraph. What exists now that did not before, in terms
a reader who has not seen the diff can follow.

**Non-obvious choices.** Anything a future reader would otherwise have to
reverse-engineer from the code, and the reason for it. Rejected alternatives
belong here, not in a comment.

**Deviations from the design plan.** What changed between
`.claude/plans/F-XXX-design.md` and the implementation, and why. "None" is a
valid and common answer.

**Spec sections touched.** The `docs/hld/` sections this story implements or
contradicts. If it contradicts one, say which and confirm the spec was updated.

**Tests.** The test gate from `docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`, plus any
others added. Name them.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged, or the expected delta and its justification.
Mandatory for every story in M1 through M6.

**Notes for future sessions.** Anything that will not be obvious in three
months. Traps found, assumptions made, follow-up worth filing.

## Entries

### F-001, Deterministic font mode

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** M, estimated 2 days, actual 1 day

**What was built.** `FontManager`, the layout engine, and `Document` now expose
an explicit rendering path that loads checked-in bundled fonts and never
discovers host fonts. The existing `bundled-fonts` feature is default-on for
the current `rdocx` consumer.

**Non-obvious choices.** Determinism is explicit rather than ambient. Normal
library rendering keeps its system-font path, while deterministic rendering
returns a clear error when bundled fonts are disabled.

**Deviations from the design plan.** The plan was revised to correct the
manifest's missing default declaration after implementation discovery showed
that the code and HLD already described bundled fonts as default-on. Microscope
pass 1 also strengthened the golden gate to inspect the actual resolved font
bytes rather than compare two calls under one environment.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md`, "Deterministic
rendering" and "Feature flags".

**Tests.** `deterministic_font_manager_uses_only_bundled_fonts`,
`deterministic_font_manager_requires_bundled_fonts`, and
`deterministic_render_is_independent_of_system_fonts`.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. F-003 recorded the first baseline after this path
was integrated.

**Notes for future sessions.** The end-to-end test verifies every font buffer
used by the inspected layout belongs to the checked-in bundled set.

### F-002, rust-toolchain.toml

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** The repository now selects Rust 1.97.1 with `rustfmt`,
`clippy`, and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` through `rust-toolchain.toml`.

**Non-obvious choices.** The workspace and CI MSRV declarations remain 1.93.
The development toolchain and the compatibility floor answer different
questions.

**Deviations from the design plan.** None.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md`, "Toolchain
pinning".

**Tests.** `rustup show active-toolchain`, installed component and target
inspection, and confirmation of every 1.93 MSRV declaration.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged.

**Notes for future sessions.** Rustup may synchronize channel metadata before
reporting the repository override, even when the toolchain is installed.

### F-003, Output-stability hash harness

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** L, estimated 4 days, actual 1 day

**What was built.** `scripts/hash_harness.py` regenerates seven samples and
compares SHA-256 values for three OOXML parts and deterministic page-one PNG
output at 150 dpi. Check mode is read-only, while update mode requires a
non-empty reason.

**Non-obvious choices.** Missing optional parts are recorded as JSON `null`
rather than omitted. The baseline has 28 sorted entries, so additions,
removals, and byte changes are reported separately.

**Deviations from the design plan.** None.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/12-testing-strategy.md`, "The hash
harness".

**Tests.** Python comparison and reason-refusal unit tests,
`python3 scripts/hash_harness.py --check`, and a temporary writer whitespace
injection that left the structural round-trip test green while changing all
seven `document.xml` digests.

**Hash harness.** Expected initial delta. Added 28 entries with reason
`F-003 initial deterministic baseline`. Manifest SHA-256 is
`9a3c64d61df793b9d8f7203df9cb966fb67201518b4f7fc0f2e68d276aaaca8f`.

**Notes for future sessions.** `invoice` has no `word/numbering.xml`, which is
the single explicit null entry in the initial baseline.

### F-004, Caladea licence and the false OFL claim

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** The `rdocx-layout` package now carries the Apache-2.0
licence and Caladea notice beside the four TTFs. Bundled-font documentation
names the correct licence per family, and a test enforces licence coverage.

**Non-obvious choices.** Attribution files live under the crate's `fonts/`
directory so they are included in the published archive with the assets they
cover.

**Deviations from the design plan.** None.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`, "Known
defects being carried", and `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md`, "Packaging".

**Tests.** `every_bundled_font_family_has_a_licence_file`, the full
`rdocx-layout` suite, upstream TTF provenance checks, and the package file list.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged.

**Notes for future sessions.** The checked-in Caladea files match the
`crosextrafonts-20130214` source archive, and the notice fields match embedded
TTF metadata.

### F-005, Fix the image counter

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** Imported media names now seed allocation from the greatest
positive numeric suffix rather than the part count. Allocation avoids existing
suffixes and remains collision-free at the finite `usize` boundary.

**Non-obvious choices.** When the greatest suffix cannot be incremented, the
counter wraps to one and skips occupied suffixes until it finds a free name.
Ordinary packages still allocate exactly maximum plus one.

**Deviations from the design plan.** Microscope passes 1 and 2 exposed overflow
and overwrite cases at `usize::MAX`. The plan was clarified to add checked
wrapping and occupied-suffix skipping without adding a media-namer abstraction.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/04-opc-and-packaging.md`, "Part naming",
and `docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`, "Known defects being carried".

**Tests.** `next_image_name_uses_the_highest_existing_index_not_the_part_count`,
`malformed_media_names_do_not_change_the_highest_image_index`,
`occupied_max_image_suffix_wraps_to_a_free_low_number`, and
`max_minus_one_allocates_max_then_wraps_safely`.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** Suffix parsing is extension-independent and
reads only consecutive ASCII digits immediately after `image`.

### F-006, Fix the JPEG standalone-marker walk

**Sprint.** S01
**Completed.** 2026-07-29
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** The JPEG dimension walk now handles SOI, TEM, and restart
markers without reading nonexistent lengths, validates every length-bearing
segment, tolerates marker fill bytes, and terminates at EOI.

**Non-obvious choices.** The parser remains a small header walk because PDF
output passes JPEG bytes through unchanged and needs only dimensions.

**Deviations from the design plan.** Microscope pass 1 found that EOI was being
skipped like a restart marker. Pass 2 verified immediate termination and the
new trailing-data regression.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/04-opc-and-packaging.md`, "Media", and
`docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`, "Known defects being carried".

**Tests.** `jpeg_restart_marker_before_sof_preserves_dimensions`,
`every_truncated_jpeg_header_returns_without_panicking`, and
`jpeg_bytes_after_eoi_cannot_supply_dimensions`.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** SOF still has to appear before EOI. Trailing
bytes after a completed JPEG cannot supply dimensions.

### F-007, Resolve core properties through the relationship

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** Document metadata now resolves through the package-level
core-properties relationship, preserves a custom part target across load and
save, and creates the conventional target only when the relationship is
missing. `rdocx-opc` exposes the standard relationship type publicly.

**Non-obvious choices.** The facade retains a private copy of the stable
relationship URI so the `rdocx 0.3.0` package can still verify against the
published `rdocx-opc 0.3.0` dependency before both move to 0.4.1.

**Deviations from the design plan.** The full packaging gate exposed the
published-dependency compatibility issue after workspace tests passed. An
independent microscope pass approved the private URI because both integration
gates cross-check it against the public constant.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/04-opc-and-packaging.md`, "Relationship
types" and "Part naming".

**Tests.** `core_properties_at_relationship_target_round_trip_in_place`,
`metadata_round_trip`, focused rdocx and OPC suites, and the clean package
dry-run.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** A non-standard target is authoritative. Saving
must not create an orphaned `/docProps/core.xml` part.

### F-008, Non-consuming setter twins

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** M, estimated 2 days, actual 1 day

**What was built.** All 61 consuming builders across `Paragraph`, `Run`,
`Table`, `Row`, and `Cell` now delegate to non-consuming `set_*` twins.

**Non-obvious choices.** Action builders receive literal `set_*` names as the
story required. Existing builder names and chaining behavior remain unchanged.

**Deviations from the design plan.** The backlog's paragraph-level bold gate
was corrected to obtain a `Run`, where bold formatting belongs. Integration
with F-007 required retaining two independent additions to the shared test
file, followed by a clean microscope pass.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/03-architecture.md`, "Facade conventions",
`docs/hld/10-bindings-spec.md`, "Two supporting decisions", and
`docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`, "F-008, Non-consuming setter twins (M)".

**Tests.** `non_consuming_setters_mutate_borrowed_wrappers` and
`non_consuming_setters_match_consuming_builders`, plus all 68 integrated rdocx
integration tests.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** Keep mutation bodies in the in-place setters so
builder and binding behavior remain single-sourced.

### F-009, Cache the layout result

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** M, estimated 2 days, actual 1 day

**What was built.** `Document` caches normal and deterministic layout results
in separate thread-safe slots, exposes cloned page layout access, and clears
both caches across direct mutations and mutable-accessor paths.

**Non-obvious choices.** `Mutex<Option<Arc<LayoutResult>>>` preserves the
`Document: Send + Sync` binding contract. Caller-supplied font layouts remain
uncached because their inputs are not part of a stable document cache key.

**Deviations from the design plan.** None. The approved plan had already
replaced the backlog's thread-local `RefCell<Option<Rc<_>>>` proposal.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/08-rendering-spec.md`, "Performance",
`docs/hld/10-bindings-spec.md`, "Two supporting decisions",
`docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`, "Known defects being carried", and
`docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`, "F-009, Cache the layout result (M)".

**Tests.** `rendering_all_pages_performs_one_layout`,
`document_mutation_invalidates_cached_layout`,
`mutable_accessor_invalidates_cached_layout`,
`font_modes_use_isolated_layout_caches`, and
`document_remains_send_and_sync`.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** Any new mutable accessor must invalidate both
layout modes before returning the borrow.

### F-010, Reserve crate names

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** Fourteen approved `oxml-*` and `rpptx*` names were
published as dependency-free `0.0.0` placeholders and verified as owned by
`mantissaman`.

**Non-obvious choices.** Python and wasm binding names were excluded because
their documented distribution channels are PyPI and npm. Publications ran
sequentially through crates.io's rolling new-crate rate limit.

**Deviations from the design plan.** None. The registry required repeated
cooldown windows, and the workflow stopped after every HTTP 429 before
resuming at the exact rejected name.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`,
"Q2, PyPI name availability", and `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md`,
"Publishing".

**Tests.** Exact `cargo info <name>@0.0.0` and owner checks for all fourteen
names, package inspection, publish dry-runs, and archive-size checks.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** The placeholders reserve names only. They expose
no implementation API and do not change any existing `rdocx 0.3.0` crate.

### F-011, Pin unit truncation behaviour

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** Fractional positive and negative tests now pin truncation
toward zero for every float constructor on `Length`, `Twips`, and `Emu`.

**Non-obvious choices.** The vectors cross the half-unit boundary so temporary
rounding mutations fail while the existing production casts remain unchanged.

**Deviations from the design plan.** Microscope pass 1 corrected one invalid
HLD heading citation. Pass 2 found no defects or smells.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/11-migration-plan.md`, "Preserve
behaviour, do not improve it", and `docs/hld/12-testing-strategy.md`, "New
tests the extracted crates need".

**Tests.** `length_float_constructors_truncate_toward_zero`,
`twips_float_constructors_truncate_toward_zero`, and
`emu_float_constructors_truncate_toward_zero`, including temporary rounding
mutations that made every gate fail.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 integrated entries match.

**Notes for future sessions.** A change from casts to rounding is a behavior
change even when whole-unit conversion tests continue to pass.

### F-012, Tag v0.4.1

**Sprint.** S02
**Completed.** 2026-07-30
**Size.** S, estimated 1 day, actual 1 day

**What was built.** The workspace was published as seven lockstep rdocx crates
at 0.4.1 from the reviewed S02 SHA. A dedicated `/release` command now owns
`v*` tags and publication, while the tag workflow verifies the deterministic
hash baseline and publishes only the approved rdocx allowlist.

**Non-obvious choices.** The published `v0.4.0` mainline was merged into S02
before release, preserving its contract changes and retargeting the planned
0.3.1 release to 0.4.1. The fourteen `oxml-*` and `rpptx*` placeholders remain
at 0.0.0 until PowerPoint development is complete.

**Deviations from the design plan.** The original plan targeted 0.3.1 before
the separate 0.4.0 release appeared. The reconciled plan and release evidence
target 0.4.1. The publication workflow retains deliberate registry-index waits
because real publication is explicitly allowlisted instead of workspace-wide.

**Spec sections touched.** `docs/hld/11-migration-plan.md`, release boundary,
`docs/hld/13-risks-and-open-questions.md`, release risks,
`docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`, M1 gate and F-012, and
`docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md`, "Publishing" and "Release process".

**Tests.** `/verify --full` passed at
`6e02a4b6417c9bb0c245237bdf8168dd06310c39`. The package dry-run produced
exactly seven archives below 10 MiB, including all 20 TTFs and required licence
files in `rdocx-layout`. GitHub Actions run 30522998328 passed, every exact
`cargo info <crate>@0.4.1` lookup succeeded, all owners were `mantissaman`, and
the GitHub release tag peeled to the reviewed SHA.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged. All 28 entries matched locally and on the Linux
publication runner.

**Notes for future sessions.** The release workflow must remain restricted to
the seven rdocx crates until PowerPoint development is complete. After S02 is
merged, forward-merge `main` into `feature/release-0.5.0` before that release
branch continues.
