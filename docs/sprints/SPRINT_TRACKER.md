# Sprint Tracker

Velocity log. One row per completed F-ID, appended by `/complete-feature`, plus
a per-sprint summary appended by `/close-sprint`.

Estimates come from `docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`. Actuals are recorded
so the velocity assumption can be corrected against reality rather than
defended.

`S = 1d`, `M = 2-3d`, `L = 4-5d`, `XL = split me`.

## Per-sprint summary

## Velocity

Recalculated at each sprint close. The backlog assumes about 2 stories per week
sustained, and the whole plan is sized at roughly 390 developer-days. If the
first three sprints diverge from that by more than 30 percent, replan rather
than absorb it.

Stories per week is completed stories divided by actual days, multiplied by
five working days.

| Window | Stories | Days | Stories/week |
|--------|---------|------|--------------|
| S01 | 6 | 6 | 5.00 |
| S02 | 6 | 6 | 5.00 |

## Escalation record

Logged when an escalation trigger from `.claude/WORKFLOW.md` fires, with what
was done about it. Empty is the expected state.

| Date | Trigger | F-ID or sprint | Response |
|------|---------|----------------|----------|
