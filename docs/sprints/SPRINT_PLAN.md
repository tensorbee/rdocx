# Sprint Plan

Sprint-by-sprint roadmap for the oxml extraction and the rpptx build. Each
sprint is approximately 2 weeks of focused work. Sprint clocks start at the
first `/start-feature` of that sprint, not at a fixed calendar date.

36 sprints across 13 milestones, roughly 390 developer-days. The sizing
rationale and the compression options are in
`docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`.

M1 to M6 are the extraction: rdocx ends on shared infrastructure and ships as
0.3.0, with no behavioural change. M7 to M12 build rpptx. M13 ships the
bindings for both.

## Goals per sprint

### M1, Preparation and safety net

#### Sprint S01, The safety net

**Goal**: rendering is reproducible across machines, a byte-level baseline
exists for every sample, and the three shipped defects found during the audit
are fixed. Nothing has moved yet.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-001 | Deterministic font mode                      | M |
| F-002 | rust-toolchain.toml                          | S |
| F-003 | Output-stability hash harness                | L |
| F-004 | Caladea licence and the false OFL claim      | S |
| F-005 | Fix the image counter                        | S |
| F-006 | Fix the JPEG standalone-marker walk          | S |

F-001 gates F-003: a baseline recorded against system fonts would not reproduce
on another machine, which would make the harness worthless.

#### Sprint S02, Prerequisites and the pre-churn tag

**Goal**: everything the later milestones depend on is in place, and a
known-good published state is tagged immediately before the extraction begins.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-007 | Resolve core properties through the rel      | S |
| F-008 | Non-consuming setter twins                   | M |
| F-009 | Cache the layout result                      | M |
| F-010 | Reserve crate names                          | S |
| F-011 | Pin unit truncation behaviour                | S |
| F-012 | Tag v0.4.1                                   | S |

F-008 is required by M13 and improves the Rust API independently. F-011 must
land before anyone is tempted to change truncation to rounding.

### M2, Shared infrastructure extraction

#### Sprint S03, oxml-core

**Goal**: the generic types leave `rdocx-oxml` and 323 call sites do not change.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-013 | Create oxml-core                             | M |
| F-014 | New unit types                               | M |
| F-015 | rdocx-oxml becomes a facade                  | S |
| F-016 | Length re-export                             | S |
| F-017 | App and custom properties                    | M |

F-015 is the load-bearing trick of the whole migration and its acceptance check
is a `git diff --stat` shape, not a behaviour.

#### Sprint S04, oxml-opc

**Goal**: the package layer is format-neutral and proven against a real pptx.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-018 | Create oxml-opc                              | M |
| F-019 | PresentationML relationship and content types| S |
| F-020 | oxml-opc reads a pptx                        | M |
| F-021 | Zip-slip hardening tests                     | S |
| F-022 | rdocx-opc deprecation shim                   | S |

F-020 converts the plan's central assumption into a test.

### M3, Media

#### Sprint S05, oxml-media

**Goal**: one crate owns image sniffing, dimensions and naming, and rdocx uses
it.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-023 | oxml-media format sniffing                   | M |
| F-024 | Image probing and DPI                        | L |
| F-025 | MediaNamer                                   | S |
| F-026 | native_size with explicit DPI                | S |
| F-027 | rdocx adopts oxml-media                      | M |
| F-028 | add_picture_auto                             | S |

F-027 produces the one expected hash-harness delta of the whole extraction:
content types become sniffed rather than trusted. Label the commit accordingly.

### M4, Layout primitives

#### Sprint S06, oxml-layout and the line.rs decoupling

**Goal**: the format-neutral layout types are extracted, including the one file
that needs genuine API design.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-029 | Create oxml-layout                           | M |
| F-030 | Decouple line.rs                             | L |
| F-031 | Transform                                    | M |

F-030 is the highest drift risk in the extraction. Own PR, own review, gated
hard on the hash harness.

#### Sprint S07, The PositionedElement extension

**Goal**: the shared element type can express a rotated, clipped,
gradient-filled shape, and rdocx's construction sites do not change.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-032 | Path and PathCommand                         | M |
| F-033 | Paint and Stroke                             | M |
| F-034 | Path and Group arms                          | M |
| F-035 | The walk helper                              | S |
| F-036 | MediaId                                      | S |

Two new arms, not ten new fields. F-035 exists specifically to prevent the
recursion hazard that S09 then tests for.

### M5, PDF backend

#### Sprint S08, The coordinate system

**Goal**: the renderer moves to one global CTM with zero pixel change.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-037 | Create oxml-pdf                              | S |
| F-038 | Golden-PNG harness                           | M |
| F-039 | Global CTM flip                              | L |

F-039 is the single highest-risk change in the plan. It lands before any pptx
code exists, so a regression has only one possible cause.

#### Sprint S09, Groups, paths and the recursion fix

**Goal**: nested content renders, and the three collection passes see inside
groups.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-040 | Group rendering                              | M |
| F-041 | Path rendering                               | M |
| F-042 | Rewrite the three collection passes on walk  | M |
| F-044 | ExtGState alpha                              | S |

F-042 is the R3 regression gate. Its three tests are the only thing standing
between this design and PDFs that silently lose fonts, images or links.

#### Sprint S10, Gradients and the rasteriser

**Goal**: both backends render everything the element types can express.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-043 | Gradient shading dictionaries                | L |
| F-045 | Rasteriser: groups, paths, gradients, dashes | L |

F-045 also fixes the dash pattern that all PNG output currently discards.

### M6, rdocx 0.3.0 release

#### Sprint S11, Ship the extraction

**Goal**: the shared infrastructure is published and rdocx is on it.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-046 | rdocx-pdf deprecation shim                   | S |
| F-047 | Packaging include and size gate              | M |
| F-048 | Replace release.sh with cargo-release        | M |
| F-049 | Rework publish.yml                           | M |
| F-050 | CI matrix additions                          | S |
| F-051 | CHANGELOG and migration notes                | S |

**This is the M6 release gate.** Everything after this point is new
construction on a shipped foundation.

### M7, DrawingML

#### Sprint S12, Colour

**Goal**: a theme colour with a transform stack resolves to the exact RGB
PowerPoint produces.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-052 | Create oxml-drawing and namespace constants  | S |
| F-053 | OrderedRawChildren                           | M |
| F-054 | Colour choices                               | M |
| F-055 | The colour transform stack                   | L |
| F-056 | Colour map resolution                        | M |

F-055's test gate is a table of 40 pairs sampled from real renders. Getting
`lumMod` wrong makes an entire deck the wrong shade.

#### Sprint S13, Geometry and fills

**Goal**: any shape's outline and fill can be described.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-057 | a:xfrm                                       | M |
| F-058 | Guide evaluator                              | L |
| F-059 | a:custGeom                                   | M |
| F-060 | Fills                                        | L |

F-058 is what makes the preset table a data problem in M10 rather than a code
problem.

#### Sprint S14, Lines, effects and text

**Goal**: the DrawingML text vocabulary is modelled.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-061 | Lines                                        | M |
| F-062 | Effects                                      | S |
| F-063 | Shape properties and style references        | M |
| F-064 | DrawingML text model                         | XL |

F-064 is sized XL deliberately. Split it at implementation into body properties,
list styles, paragraphs and runs, and bullets.

#### Sprint S15, Theme

**Goal**: themes read and write, and rdocx adopts the shared type without
changing behaviour.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-065 | Theme read and write                         | L |
| F-066 | The rdocx Theme adapter                      | S |

F-066's test gate is the hash harness being unchanged. The Word tint and shade
path is deliberately left alone.

### M8, PresentationML

#### Sprint S16, Parts and the shape tree

**Goal**: the corpus round-trips with everything opaque, then with the core
parts modelled.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-067 | Create rpptx-oxml and the corpus harness     | M |
| F-068 | presentation.xml                             | M |
| F-069 | Slide, layout and master parts               | L |
| F-070 | The shape tree                               | L |

F-067's raw round-trip proves the OPC layer and the corpus harness before any
XML modelling exists.

#### Sprint S17, Placeholders, pictures and tables

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-071 | Placeholders                                 | M |
| F-072 | Pictures                                     | M |
| F-073 | Graphic frames                               | M |
| F-074 | DrawingML tables                             | L |

#### Sprint S18, The long tail

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-075 | Connectors                                   | S |
| F-076 | mc:AlternateContent                          | M |
| F-077 | Notes slides and notes master                | M |
| F-078 | relmap rewrite_rel_ids                       | M |

F-078 is what makes deep copy safe in M11. Without it a duplicated slide's
SmartArt points at the source slide's relationships.

#### Sprint S19, The read facade

**Goal**: open any deck and read it.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-079 | The rpptx read facade                        | L |
| F-080 | Modelled round-trip gate                     | M |

**This is the M8 gate**: all 50 decks round-trip and every one opens in
PowerPoint without a repair prompt.

### M9, Inheritance resolver

#### Sprint S20, The chains

**Goal**: every inherited property resolves.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-081 | ResolveCtx skeleton and placeholder chain    | M |
| F-082 | Effective transform and body properties      | M |
| F-083 | The seven-step list style merge              | L |
| F-084 | Format scheme reference resolution           | M |
| F-085 | Typeface resolution                          | S |

#### Sprint S21, Draw order and the contract

**Goal**: `ResolvedSlide` is frozen and correct.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-086 | Draw order and the flattener                 | L |
| F-087 | ResolvedSlide contract                       | M |
| F-088 | Visual differential tests                    | M |

F-086's test gate is that a rendered slide contains no "Click to edit Master
title style". Placeholders on layouts and masters are templates, never drawn.

### M10, Renderer

#### Sprint S22, Geometry

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-089 | Resolve the preset geometry licensing question | S |
| F-090 | Preset table generator                       | L |
| F-091 | Preset evaluation and fallback               | M |
| F-092 | rpptx-render skeleton and RenderInput        | M |

F-089 is a decision, not code, and it blocks F-090. LibreOffice's table is
MPL-2.0 and cannot be used.

#### Sprint S23, Shapes

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-093 | Shape geometry, fills and lines              | L |
| F-094 | Rotation, flips and groups                   | M |
| F-095 | Arrowheads                                   | S |
| F-096 | Pictures with crop and tile                  | M |
| F-097 | Backgrounds                                  | S |

Ships slides with shapes but no text.

#### Sprint S24, Text

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-098 | Shape text layout                            | XL |
| F-099 | Bullets                                      | M |
| F-100 | Autofit                                      | M |
| F-101 | Vertical text                                | S |

**The milestone that makes the project real.** F-098 is XL and splits at
implementation into the content box, paragraph resolution, line stacking and
anchoring.

#### Sprint S25, Tables and the fidelity gate

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-102 | Table rendering                              | L |
| F-103 | Hyperlinks, fields and diagnostics           | M |
| F-104 | SSIM fidelity harness                        | L |

**This is the M10 gate** and the natural point to cut an early
read-plus-render release if the schedule needs compressing.

### M11, Write API

#### Sprint S26, Slides

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-105 | Bundled default.pptx                         | M |
| F-106 | ShapeIdAllocator and MediaStore              | M |
| F-107 | add_slide                                    | L |
| F-108 | validate()                                   | M |

F-108 will save more debugging time than any other story in the backlog.

#### Sprint S27, Shapes and text

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-109 | Shape mutation facade                        | L |
| F-110 | add_textbox, add_shape, add_connector, group | M |
| F-111 | add_picture                                  | M |
| F-112 | Text frame mutation                          | L |

#### Sprint S28, Tables and acceptance

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-113 | Table facade                                 | L |
| F-114 | remove_slide, move_slide, duplicate_slide    | M |
| F-115 | Slide and presentation properties            | S |
| F-116 | Cross-viewer acceptance                      | M |

**This is the M11 gate**: a generated deck opens clean in PowerPoint, Keynote,
Google Slides and LibreOffice.

### M12, Charts

#### Sprint S29, The data layer

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-117 | oxml-sml workbook writer                     | L |
| F-118 | ChartML core types                           | L |
| F-119 | Series and data references                   | L |

F-119's caches are what actually render. A chart written without them is empty
in most viewers.

#### Sprint S30, Axes and plots

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-120 | Axes                                         | L |
| F-121 | Bar and line plots                           | M |
| F-122 | Pie, doughnut, area, scatter and radar plots | L |
| F-123 | Data labels and number formats               | M |

#### Sprint S31, Authoring and rendering

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-124 | add_chart                                    | L |
| F-125 | Chart rendering: geometry                    | L |
| F-126 | Chart rendering: axes, gridlines and labels  | L |

#### Sprint S32, Chart polish

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-127 | Chart colour resolution                      | M |
| F-128 | Preserved chart fallback                     | S |

### M13, Bindings and tooling

#### Sprint S33, rdocx-py

**Goal**: the handle design is validated against the settled API before it is
reused.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-129 | oxml-py-support                              | M |
| F-130 | rdocx-py core                                | L |
| F-131 | rdocx-py formatting and tables               | L |
| F-132 | Python enums, units and exceptions           | M |
| F-133 | rdocx-py rendering with allow_threads        | S |

#### Sprint S34, Wheels and rpptx-py

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-134 | Type stubs and py.typed                      | M |
| F-135 | python-docx parity suite                     | M |
| F-136 | rpptx-py                                     | L |
| F-137 | wheels.yml                                   | M |
| F-138 | PR-time Python job                           | S |

#### Sprint S35, WASM

**Goal**: the wasm crates wrap the real facades and are watched by CI.

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-139 | Rewrite rdocx-wasm                           | L |
| F-140 | wasm CI job                                  | S |
| F-141 | to_pdf in the browser                        | M |
| F-142 | rpptx-wasm                                   | M |

F-139 fixes a shipped defect that silently discards every package part except
two. F-140 is why it will not happen again.

#### Sprint S36, CLIs and publication

| F-ID | Title | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| F-143 | oxml-cli-support                             | S |
| F-144 | rpptx-cli                                    | L |
| F-145 | rpptx-cli thumbnail and outline              | M |
| F-146 | npm publication                              | S |

**This is the v1 release gate.**

## Cross-cutting

F-X001 through F-X004 are opportunistic and unscheduled. Pull one into a sprint
when it becomes relevant, or when a sprint has capacity.
